In this article, we will show you two possible ways to play this game on your PS Vita: using a PSP emulator or using a custom firmware. Both methods require some technical skills and may involve some risks, so please proceed with caution and at your own responsibility.
  
## Using a PSP Emulator
 
A PSP emulator is a software that allows you to run PSP games on other devices, such as PC, Android, or PS Vita. There are several PSP emulators available online, but the most popular one for PS Vita is Adrenaline. Adrenaline is a homebrew application that mimics the official PSP firmware and lets you play PSP games and PS1 games on your PS Vita.
 
To use Adrenaline, you will need to have a PS Vita with firmware 3.60 or lower, and install HENkaku, a custom firmware that enables homebrew on your device. You will also need to have a PSN account and activate your device online. You can find detailed instructions on how to install HENkaku and Adrenaline on various websites and YouTube videos.
 
Once you have Adrenaline installed on your PS Vita, you will need to download the ISO file of Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team from a reliable source. You can search for it online or use a torrent client. Make sure the file is clean and compatible with your region. You will also need to download a save data file that contains all the unlocked characters and modes.
 
After downloading the files, you will need to transfer them to your PS Vita using a USB cable or an FTP client. You will need to create a folder named "ISO" in the root of your memory card, and copy the ISO file there. You will also need to create a folder named "PSP" in the root of your memory card, and copy the save data file there.
 
Now you are ready to play Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team on your PS Vita. Just launch Adrenaline, select the game from the menu, and enjoy!
  
## Using a Custom Firmware
 
Another way to play Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team on your PS Vita is to use a custom firmware that allows you to run PSP games natively on your device. The most popular custom firmware for PS Vita is Enso, which is based on HENkaku. Enso is a permanent hack that runs on boot, so you don't need to launch it every time you turn on your device.
 
To use Enso, you will need to have a PS Vita with firmware 3.65 or lower, and install HENkaku first. You will also need to have a PSN account and activate your device online. You can find detailed instructions on how to install HENkaku and Enso on various websites and YouTube videos.
 
Once you have Enso installed on your PS Vita, you will need to download the ISO file of Dragon Ball Z: Tenkaichi Tag Team from a reliable source. You can search for it online or use a torrent client. Make sure the file is clean and compatible with your region. You will also need to download a plugin called Adrenaline Bubble Manager, which allows you to create bubbles for your PSP games on your home screen.
 
After downloading the files, you will need to transfer them to your PS Vita using a USB cable or an FTP client. You will need to create a folder named "ISO" in the root of your memory card, and copy the ISO file there. You will also need to copy the Adrenaline Bubble Manager plugin to the "ux0:tai" folder on
