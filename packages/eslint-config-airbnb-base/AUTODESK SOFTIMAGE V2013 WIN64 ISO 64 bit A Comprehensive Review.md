AUTODESK SOFTIMAGE V2013 WIN64 ISO 64 bit is a software package that includes the following components:
 
- **SOFTIMAGE**: This is the main application that provides a comprehensive set of tools for 3D modeling, animation, rendering, and compositing. You can use it to create realistic characters, environments, effects, and motion graphics.
- **ICE**: This stands for Interactive Creative Environment, and it is a node-based visual programming system that allows you to create complex effects and simulations without writing any code. You can use it to generate particles, fluids, hair, cloth, crowds, and more.
- **Lagoa**: This is a physics-based simulation engine that integrates with ICE and enables you to create realistic fluid dynamics, soft bodies, rigid bodies, and deformable meshes.
- **Bullet**: This is another physics-based simulation engine that integrates with ICE and enables you to create realistic collisions and rigid body dynamics.
- **Face Robot**: This is a tool that allows you to create realistic facial animation and lip sync for your characters. You can use it to capture facial motion from video or audio sources, or manually edit the facial expressions.
- **CAT**: This stands for Character Animation Toolkit, and it is a tool that allows you to create realistic skeletal animation and rigging for your characters. You can use it to create custom rigs, apply motion capture data, or animate manually.
- **MOTOR**: This is a tool that allows you to transfer animation data between different applications and formats. You can use it to convert animation curves, blend shapes, skeletons, and skinning data.
- **Crosswalk**: This is a tool that allows you to transfer scene data between different applications and formats. You can use it to convert geometry, materials, textures, lights, cameras, and more.
