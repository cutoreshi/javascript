Labor law is an important and dynamic field of law that affects the rights and welfare of millions of workers in the Philippines. It regulates the relationship between employers and employees, as well as between labor unions and management. It also sets the standards and policies for the protection and promotion of labor rights, such as minimum wage, social security, health and safety, and dispute resolution.
 
The main source of labor law in the Philippines is the Labor Code of the Philippines, which was enacted in 1974 by President Ferdinand Marcos. The Labor Code covers various aspects of employment, such as pre-employment, human resources development, conditions of employment, health, safety and social welfare, labor relations, and post-employment. It also provides for the creation and functions of various labor agencies, such as the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE), the National Labor Relations Commission (NLRC), the Bureau of Labor Relations (BLR), and the Philippine Overseas Employment Administration (POEA).
 
The Labor Code is not a static law, however. It has been amended several times to address the changing needs and demands of the labor sector. For instance, in 1989, Republic Act No. 6715 was passed to strengthen the right of workers to self-organization and collective bargaining. In 1995, Republic Act No. 8042 was passed to institute the policies for overseas Filipino workers. In 2000, Republic Act No. 8762 was passed to rationalize the minimum wage setting mechanism. In 2018, Republic Act No. 11058 was passed to enhance compliance with occupational safety and health standards.
 
Apart from the Labor Code and its amendments, there are also other sources of labor law in the Philippines, such as the Constitution, international treaties and conventions, executive orders, department orders, labor advisories, rules and regulations, jurisprudence, and customary practices. These sources complement and supplement the Labor Code in providing a comprehensive and coherent framework for labor law in the Philippines.
